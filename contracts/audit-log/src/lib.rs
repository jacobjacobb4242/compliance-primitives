//! `audit-log` is a `#![no_std]` Soroban contract that provides an
//! **on-chain, append-only audit trail** for compliance events emitted by
//! other primitives in this workspace (and any caller that integrates it).
//!
//! ## Why on-chain instead of off-chain indexing?
//!
//! Off-chain indexers (Horizon, Mercury, custom event pipelines) are the
//! right tool for analytics and dashboards, but they have a gap: another
//! contract cannot read their state at transaction time. An on-chain audit
//! log fills that gap:
//!
//! - **Single queryable address** — any contract or client that knows the
//!   log's contract ID can call `get_entry(index)` or `entry_count()` at
//!   invocation time, enabling on-chain proof-of-audit patterns (e.g. a
//!   settlement contract that verifies a prior compliance event exists).
//! - **Immutable trail** — entries are written with persistent storage and
//!   never deleted; the append-only counter guarantees ordering.
//! - **No indexer dependency** — the log is readable even before an indexer
//!   has caught up, and remains correct if the indexer is unavailable.
//! - **Tradeoff** — every `record` call costs ledger storage (one
//!   persistent entry per event). This is appropriate for lower-frequency
//!   compliance events (denylist mutations, jurisdiction overrides) rather
//!   than high-throughput transfer events; for the latter, rely on the
//!   standard Soroban event stream.
//!
//! ## Write volume and storage growth
//!
//! Each `record` call does two storage writes: one new persistent entry at
//! `DataKey::Entry(index)` and an update to the `EntryCount` counter in
//! instance storage. Both are unmeasured estimates here; re-measure with the
//! method in `BENCHMARKS.md` before relying on any number.
//!
//! - **Per-entry footprint** — roughly 150–300 bytes for typical entries
//!   (two `Address` values, a `Symbol`, a `detail` string of up to a few
//!   dozen bytes, and a `u32` ledger). Rent scales with bytes × retained
//!   ledgers, so total storage cost grows linearly with event count and
//!   retention period.
//! - **Throughput ceiling** — every `record` on one instance reads and
//!   writes the same `EntryCount` key, so calls serialize. A single audit
//!   log cannot absorb more than roughly one `record` per ledger (about one
//!   every ~5 seconds), and bursts of concurrent submissions should be
//!   expected to fail and need retry.
//! - **Volume guidance** (indicative, not benchmarked):
//!   - up to ~1,000 events/day: direct on-chain logging is comfortable;
//!   - ~1,000–10,000 events/day: viable, but budget for rent and retry
//!     handling, and keep `detail` short;
//!   - above ~10,000 events/day: keep the on-chain log for the events that
//!     must be provable on-chain, rely on the Soroban event stream and an
//!     off-chain indexer for the rest, and consider committing a periodic
//!     hash or Merkle root of a batch on-chain instead of every event.
//! - **TTL** — `record` extends each new entry's TTL (see "Storage and TTL
//!   policy" below), but entries that are never touched again still expire
//!   once that window lapses. Issuers relying on retention beyond ~90 days
//!   must run an external restore/extend process; until then, do not treat
//!   `get_entry` as a durable record past that window.
//!
//! ## Callers
//!
//! - **Writers (`record`)** — contracts registered as an audit-log source.
//!   The caller passes its own address as `source`, and that address must
//!   authorize the invocation (`source.require_auth()`), so one primitive
//!   cannot write entries attributed to another. The ledger sequence is
//!   stamped on each entry by the log itself.
//! - **Admin (`initialize`, `pause`, `unpause`)** — the address passed to
//!   `initialize` (exactly once) can pause and resume writes. The admin is
//!   *not* checked on `record`: any authorized `source` may write while the
//!   log is unpaused.
//! - **Readers (`get_entry`, `entry_count`, `list_entries`, `is_paused`)** —
//!   unauthenticated. Any contract, client, or script can read. `list_entries`
//!   returns at most [`MAX_PAGE_SIZE`] entries per call and fails with
//!   `PageTooLarge` above that, so larger reads page through `start`.
//! - **Indexers** — subscribe to the `ComplianceEvent` contract event
//!   (topics: `kind`, `subject`) rather than polling storage.
//!
//! ## Composition with the other primitives
//!
//! `audit-log` has no dependency on the other compliance contracts; its only
//! workspace dependency is the shared `compliance-pausable` crate, which
//! provides the pause storage and the write guard used by `pause`,
//! `unpause`, and `record`.
//!
//! - **`denylist-gate`** is the reference integration. It depends on this
//!   crate and exposes `set_audit_log(admin, audit_log_id)`. Once set, each
//!   denylist add and remove calls `record` through the generated
//!   `AuditLogClient`, with `deny_add` / `deny_remove` as the kind and the
//!   denylisted address as the subject.
//! - **`AuditLogInterface`** (below) is the trait to copy or depend on when a
//!   caller wants to invoke `record` without linking this contract's binary.
//! - Other primitives do not write to the log today. Wiring one in follows
//!   the same opt-in pattern.
//!
//! ## Opt-in integration pattern
//!
//! This contract is **not** called automatically by the other primitives.
//! A deployer wires it in by:
//!
//! 1. Deploying an `audit-log` instance and noting its contract ID.
//! 2. Calling `set_audit_log(admin, audit_log_id)` on the primitive (e.g.
//!    `denylist-gate`) to register the log address.
//! 3. From that point on, every state-mutating call on the primitive will
//!    additionally call `audit-log.record(...)` via cross-contract
//!    invocation — the primitive acts as the `source` address in the entry.
//!
//! If `set_audit_log` is never called, the primitive behaves exactly as
//! before: the audit log path is guarded by an `if let Some(...)` check on
//! the stored audit-log address, so it adds no cross-contract call when the
//! feature is not configured.
//!
//! ## Storage and TTL policy
//!
//! Each log entry lives in **persistent** storage under its own key. Every
//! write path (`record`) extends that entry's TTL: whenever the remaining TTL
//! has dropped below [`ENTRY_TTL_THRESHOLD`] (~7 days) it is bumped back up to
//! [`ENTRY_TTL_EXTEND_TO`] (~90 days). This keeps recorded events from being
//! archived by Soroban state expiration — an archived entry would make
//! `get_entry` and `list_entries` return nothing until a manual restore.
//!
//! ## Upgradeability
//!
//! `upgrade(admin, new_wasm_hash)` lets the configured admin move the
//! contract's code to a new WASM hash via
//! `env.deployer().update_current_contract_wasm`, following the same
//! admin-gated pattern used by `compliance-aggregator` and `jurisdiction-flag`.
//! Only the stored admin may call it; any other caller is rejected with
//! `Error::NotAuthorized`, and calling it before `initialize` returns
//! `Error::NotInitialized`. An `UpgradePerformed` event is emitted so the
//! upgrade is visible to indexers.
//!
//! The WASM swap does not touch storage: the admin key and the entry counter
//! live in instance storage, and every `Entry(index)` lives in persistent
//! storage under the same `DataKey` variants, so the log is intact and
//! callable immediately after the upgrade. See `UPGRADE.md` in this crate for
//! the full procedure and the storage rules a new version must follow.
